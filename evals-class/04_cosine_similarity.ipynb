In 2019 we worked with the Department for Transportâ€™s data science team to consider the role that AI could play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the policy consultation process. In 2022 we used AI to create a vision for the future of Hounslow with the local authority. In 2023, we commissioned the creation of the Ecological Intelligence Agency, a speculative artefact to help experience the role AI might have in future decision-making in environmental policy. \n",
