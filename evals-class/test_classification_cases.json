            "article": "Policy Lab has experimented with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in policy development with teams across government, and beyond, for a number of years. In 2019 we worked with the Department for Transport\u2019s data science team to consider the role that AI could play in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the policy consultation process. In 2022 we used AI to create a vision for the future of Hounslow with the local authority. In 2023, we commissioned the creation of the Ecological Intelligence Agency, a speculative artefact to help experience the role AI might have in future decision-making in environmental policy. \n\nThis blog explains how Policy Lab used generative AI in policy relating to the future of the subsurface. Broadly speaking, generative AI can be understood as systems that create new data, which could be new code, text, images, video or other forms of data. We used generative AI to visualise evidence, bring to life policy ideas, and create this blog, written iteratively with a system trained on Policy Lab\u2019s publicly available content.",

I’ve worked in many different areas, from the justice system to telecoms regulation, but the common theme for me has always been about improving public services and delivering better outcomes for people.

It’s a long-term strategic partnership between the Environment Agency and the Met Office supporting national flood resilience in a changing climate. The Centre forecasts for all natural forms of flooding including from rivers, surface water, groundwater and the sea.  They are a key link between Met Office Strategic Operations Centre and the EA’s Local Forecasting Centres and have been successfully running now for 15 years.",
